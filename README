---+ Thea2 : Prolog Modules for OWL2

This is a collection of modules for parsing and manipulating OWL2
ontologies in Prolog. It is developed with SWI-Prolog in mind, but the
goal is to maximize portability with other prologs, such as Yap and
XSB.

This module is currently in alpha status - aspects may change
radically!

---++ Overview

The model is based on Structural Specification and Functional-Style
Syntax for OWL2 (http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax), and can be found
in owl2_model.pl

Predicates such as subClassOf/2 can be used to query in-memory axioms

There are a variety of surface forms for OWL2. The goal is to
eventually support all of these for both parsing and writing. So far
we have (incomplete) parsers for:

* RDF - owl2_from_rdf.pl
* OWL-XML - owl2_xml.pl

We also allow for reading and writing from prolog factfiles

The module owl2_io.pl is used for reading and writing other formats
and languages. For example:

==
swipl -g "[library('thea2/owl2_io')],load_axioms('testfiles/wine.owl',owl)"
==

See

* Cookbook.txt

For some handy recipes

---++ SWRL support

The module swrl.pl provides support for the Semantic Web Rules Language

SWRL rules are treated as axioms, extending owl2_model.pl

In addition, we allow for representation of rules as prolog terms and
prolog programs - there is a partial converter from prolog programs to
OWL2+SWRL

---++ Reasoning support

The DLP subset of OWL2-DL can be translated to logic programs using a
transormation defined by Grosof. See owl2_to_prolog_dlp.pl

The resulting programs can be used with Prologs such as Yap and
XSB. There are also hooks for answer set programming and disjunctive
datalog systems such as DLV.

There is also a very partial TBox reasoner in owl2_reasoner.pl, and an
ad-hoc reasoner in owl2_basic_reasoner.pl that can be used with a
non-tabled prolog such as SWI; however, this gives incomplete results.

The DIG interface from Thea1 has yet to be converted.

You can also use java reasoners via the OWLAPI bridge. See
owl2_owlapi_java.pl

---++ Utilities

Currently the owl2_util.pl is a grab-bag of ad-hoc utility
predicates. Browse this to get an idea of some of the capabilities.

For example, one useful predicate is use_labels_for_IRIs/0

---++ Relationship to SWI-Prolog SemWeb Library

Currently we use rdf_db.pl to translate from OWL RDF-XML to OWL
axioms. This 'consumes' the triples in the RDF database. Eventually we
would like a dynamic view over an RDF database, although this will be
difficult due to the non-monotonic nature of the mapping between RDF
and OWL.

---++ Optional Extras

The core modules are

* owl2_model.pl -- for representing and manipulating axioms and expressions in OWL ontologies
* owl2_io.pl -- for reading/writing axioms

However, there are various additional modules that are not required
but may be useful for specific purposes. Here is an overview of what
is currently distributed (some of these may move to separate
distributions):

---+++ Web interface

There is the beginnings of a primitive web front end:

* prolege_server.pl

---+++ Integration with other LP systems

Pure prolog, disjunctive datalog, description logics etc are all
related families of languages constituting some subset of first-order
logic. Each offers its own inference procedures including the prolog
WAM, SLG resolution, DL reasoners, ILP etc. Navigating this territory
can be difficult due to a lack of standards. Thea aims to make this
easier.

See Cookbook.txt for some recipes

---+++ Integration with exteral tools

---++++ OWLAPI

If you have JPL installed you can use a bridge module to access
all the capabilities of the OWLAPI. This includes reasoners such as
Pellet and FaCT++.

* owl2_java_owlapi.pl

Requires JPL

---++++ OWLGRES

Owlgres is an open source, database-backed scalable reasoner for
OWL2.  

* owl2_sqlmap_owlgres.pl - allows ABox axiom predicates to be mapped
to an OWLGRES database

Requirements:

* ODBC
* sql_compiler.pro (currently distributed as part of blipkit)
