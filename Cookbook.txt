---+++ Converting prolog to OWL

A certain subset of pure prolog programs can be converted to OWL and
reasoner over using OWL reasoners. This is currently a two-step
process.

* prolog -> SWRL
* SWRL -> OWL

For the first step, only binary and unary predicates are
converted. For the second step, certain rule patterns can be
translated to OWL axioms.

==
:- use_module(library('thea2/owl2_io')).
:- use_module(library('thea2/swrl')).

demo :-
   load_axioms('testfiles/dlptest.pro',pl_swrl_owl,[])),
   save_axioms(_,owlpl). % TODO - change to owl once we have rdf writing
==

For example, the following piece of prolog:

==
r(X,Y):-
     s(X,Z),t(Y,Z).
==

is first translated to a SWRL rule and then to an OWL subPropertyOf/2 axiom:

==
subPropertyOf(r, propertyChain([s, inverseOf(t)])) 
==
